                <div class="paragraphs_margin">
                    <p class="paragraphs__item">The Evergoing Products Group began manufacturing inflatable boats and
                        dinghies over 35 years ago. The value these boats propelled “EPG” into major private branding
                        relationships with some of the largest marine companies in the world. The affordable and
                        well-constructed boats quickly found favor with families seeking marine recreation and the
                        chance to
                        get on the water.</p>
                    <p class="paragraphs__item">The all-inclusive, quickly inflated, rugged boat in a carry bag is
                        easily
                        stowed in the hold of larger craft, or in the trunk of the family car. The company’s success
                        propelled them into a broader category of watercraft that now include, rigid hull inflatables,
                        white
                        water rafts, kayaks and pontoons – frequently built for industrial applications.</p>
                    <p class="paragraphs__item">EPG continues to design and develop a wide variety of private label
                        outdoor
                        products, including camping, fishing, hunting and outdoor apparel for large private venders,
                        including some of the largest big box and online retailers in the marketplace today.</p>
                    <p class="paragraphs__item">With continued and projected growth EPG is becoming much more than a
                        sporting goods and outdoor resource. The company’s growing staff continues their focus on
                        creating
                        affordable, family-oriented fun with every product developed.</p>
